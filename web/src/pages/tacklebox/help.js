            <p>Casual fishing is how the game starts out.</p>
            <p>
                Once a fish bites, mash on A until you have filled the progress
                bar
            </p>

            <h2>How to fish: pro mode</h2>
            <div className="alert">
                Pro mode is not availabe at first, you might need to talk to
                someone to get it enabled (hint hint)
            </div>
            <p>Pro fishing is a bit trickier.</p>
            <p>
                There are two progress bars, a big one and a little one. You
                need to keep the big progress bar's value inside the little one
                until the little one fills up.
            </p>
            <img
                className="proFishingImg"
                src={proFishingImg}
                alt="pro fishing"
            />
            <p>
                Here the player is winning, the big progress bar is right where
                it needs to be
            </p>
            <p>
                Pro fishing requires more focus and better simulates fishing.
                Pro fishing is challenging with the advanced fishes in the
                ocean.
            </p>

        <Hint>Having trouble finding worms? try hunting for them at night</Hint>
        <Hint>Ocean fish aren't tempted by worms, you'll need better bait</Hint>
        <Hint>Got another old boot? Bummer. But, they do have a use!</Hint>

            Still need a few fish and just can't find them? Buy Bear's advice in
